# Computer-Science-Entry 

>Well, there are a huge number of roads to master the basics, there are also a huge 
number of resources.
This is the most suitable one in my opinion

## What are the Basics?

To format a word, you have to know the alphabet, consider the basics
an alphabet that you need to learn before choosing any computer science track.

## Computer-Science-Basics:
1. Introduction to Computer Science
2. Introduction to Computational Thinking 
3. Dive into Programming Language
4. Data Structure and Algorithms
5. Database
6. Operating Systems 


### Introduction to Computer Science

There are two great courses, One provided by MIT, the second provided by Harvard

both are great!

1- [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)

OR

2- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

> please note that you can audit the course and take it for free!

> please note that you can use subtitle if you find it hard to understand only in english
